Welcome to My repository.

You can find all my journey with projects here.
A lot of work was created during full-stack bootcamp.

I can program mostly in JS and typescript. 

I know how to use react library for front-end fork.
For work with backend I can create some express js servers or use NestJS framework to set up more complex project with typeorm to use with relationship database (mysql, postsql).

I am in process of honing and extending my skills by creating small projects that will show from time to time on this repository.
